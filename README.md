For a description of our method see:

M. Oberweger and V. Lepetit. DeepPrior++: Improving Fast and Accurate 3D Hand Pose Estimation. In ICCV Workshop, 2017.

## Setup:
  * Put dataset files into ./data (e.g. [ICVL](http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/~dtang/hand.html), or [MSRA](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx2w0zbnyghtp7/cvpr15_MSRAHandGestureDB.zip?dl=0) (thanks to @geliuhao for providing), or [NYU](http://cims.nyu.edu/~tompson/NYU_Hand_Pose_Dataset.htm) dataset)
  * Goto ./src and see the main file test_realtimepipeline.py how to handle the API
  * Camera interface for the Creative Senz3D is included in ./src/util. Build them with `cmake . && make`.

## Pretrained models:
[Download](https://files.icg.tugraz.at/f/04cad84751/?dl=1) pretrained models for ICVL and NYU dataset.

## Datasets:
The ICVL and MSRA dataset is trained for a time-of-flight camera, and the NYU dataset for a structured light camera. The annotations are different. See the papers for it.
